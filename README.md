In this project, I have created a scene in which the player has health and is assigned with job to shoot enemies
as much as he can. The enemies are abundant with certain health and they can shoot back. In this project, 
certain concepts are convered including rigidbody2d, boxCollider2D, Coroutine, Prefab, Static Variables, OnTriggerEnter2D, 
Instance, BackGround Scrolling and etc.
